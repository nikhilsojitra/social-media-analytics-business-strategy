Social Media Analytics for Business Strategy

Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of a Social Media Analytics tool designed to help organizations understand customer sentiment, brand perception, and market trends using social media data. The system collects publicly available social media posts, processes and analyzes the data, and presents insights through visualizations and an interactive dashboard. The project demonstrates how data-driven insights can support business and marketing decision-making.

Project Objectives
Collect social media data using public APIs
Clean and preprocess unstructured text data
Perform sentiment analysis on social media posts
Identify trending keywords and topics
Visualize insights using charts and dashboards
Support data-driven business strategy decisions

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Data Collection: Tweepy (Twitter API)
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob, VADER
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Dashboard: Streamlit

System Architecture
The project follows a modular architecture:
Data Collection Module – Fetches social media data using APIs
Data Processing Module – Cleans and prepares the data
Analysis Module – Performs sentiment and keyword analysis
Visualization Module – Displays insights through charts and dashboards
This modular approach improves clarity, scalability, and maintainability.

Dataset
The dataset is collected from social media platforms using publicly available APIs.
The data includes:
Post text
Username
Timestamp
Likes and engagement metrics
Hashtags and keywords
Processed datasets are stored in CSV format for analysis and visualization.

Usage
Enter a keyword or hashtag in the dashboard
View sentiment analysis results (positive, negative, neutral)
Explore trending topics using word clouds
Analyze engagement metrics through visual charts
Download processed data for further analysis

Results and Visualizations
The dashboard provides:
Sentiment distribution charts
Word clouds showing trending keywords
Engagement metrics such as likes and retweets
Time-based trends of social media discussions
These insights help stakeholders quickly understand audience perception and behavior.

Limitations
The project focuses on a single social media platform
Sentiment analysis may not always detect sarcasm or context accurately
API access may limit historical data availability

Future Improvements
Integration of multiple social media platforms
Use of advanced machine learning models for sentiment analysis
Predictive analytics for trend forecasting
Automated reporting for stakeholders
